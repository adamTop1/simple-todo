# Simple Todo App React + TypeScript

This project is a straightforward Todo application built using React and TypeScript, with state management handled through the useContext hook. Error notifications are implemented using React Toastify, and the visual styling is accomplished with Tailwind CSS. Notably, this marks my initial venture into TypeScript development.

Technologies Used:
- TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language.
- useContext: A React hook used for state management, facilitating communication between components.
- React Toastify: Employed for displaying error notifications in a user-friendly manner.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that streamlines the styling process.
